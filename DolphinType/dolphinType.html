        <h1> What your dolphin type means: </h1>
        <div>
            <p>Bottlenose dolphins are likely to be more friendly and optimistic than those around them. They often know a little about 
                their wide varitety of interests but lack the much deeper knowledge of any particular subject that others their age might 
                possess. They usually find that they have a large crowd of supporting friends and exccel in customer facing roles.
                They are usually resistant to change and take on the problems of others without complaint, often to their own detrament.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Orcas like to stand out from the crowd. They have big personalities and are willing to do anything they can to prove it.
                Orcas can be extremely prideful and often treat everything as a game that can be won or lost. They regularly find themselves 
                easily bored but learn to harness this to have a million ideas a second bringing out their creativity and passion. This makes
                them great at jobs where ingenuity is an essential element.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Spinner Dolphins are free spirits, not liking to be held to any place or person. They tend to be more esoteric than others and feel
                the need to constantly be working on something. They often find the quickest solutions to any problems which others often overlook
                Once they have their minds set on a project, they often find it takes over. This dedication helps to make them great artists and
                excelent writers, where their dedication and ability to see things others can't can truly thrive.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>River Dolphins are more reserved than their peers. They accept the presence of a comfortable silence and embrace being alone.
                While river dolphins tend to have a small number of incredibly close friends. Sometimes river dolphins feel like outcasts but
                their unique perspective often makes them some of the most successful people having wealth and oppertunities their peers can 
                only dream of.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Bionic Death Dolphins tend to be blunt and often accidentally offend or hurt others without their knowing which contributes to the
                stereotype that they are mean or violent. however, despite first impressions, bionic death dolphins usually have kind hearts. 
                Their unique perspective allows them to see solutions to problems that others are too emotionally clouded to see for themselves,
                making them pragmatic leaders and successful buisness owners.
