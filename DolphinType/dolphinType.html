                    Bottlenose dolphins are the archetypal dolphin, having gained fame from movies and their presense in aquatic parks. However, 
                    contrary to popular belief, they are not the most common dolphin worldwide. That title is owed to the common dolphin. Despite
                    this they are one of the most widely studied species of dolphin and have been shown to be capable of communication through
                    language, using tools, self regognition and the ability to pass knowledge on to the next generation which are products of 
                    their complex intelligence. Bottlenose Dolphins have a long history with humans, from driving fish into fishermen's nets to
                    locating sea mines.

                    Orcas are the largest species of dolphin in the world. They inhabit a wide variety of regions, stretching from pole to pole.
                    Their diets are also incredibly diverse, consisting of seals, sharks, whales and even other species of dolphins. Their nickname,
                    the killer whale comes from ancient sailors who observed them hunting and killing whales. Orcas have been known to kill humans in
                    captivity, where they are often kept in conditions damaging to their health, but never in the wild.

                    Spinner Dolphins are a small dolphin that inhabits mostly costal waters around the tropics. They are known for their acrobatic
                    spins which they do as they swim across the waves. A dolphin can make up to seven spins in a single jump. Their scientific name, 
                    stenella longirostris means narrow long beaked dolphin, one of their key characteristics.

                    River dolphins inhabit rivers all around the world. In the Amazon, there are five different species of river dolphins. Often
                    recognised by their pink colourings, river dolphins can also be grey. Amazon river dolphins are the largest of the river dolphins
                    and have long noses which they use to search for and hunt food amongst the river's vegitation. They have been known to take advantage
                    of boat wakes to catch stunned prey.

                    Bionic death dolphins are cybernetically enhanced bottlenose dolphins. They are equipped with a multitude of weapons including 
                    laser eyes and sword fins. These modifications and their extreme intelligence have allowed them to become the ultimate predators.
                    However, their populaton remains very small, mostly due to the billion dollar expense of creating new cybernetic implants. Though 
                    originally designed to destroy submarines in the cold war, they are now rogue elements, patrolling the seas freely.

                    Bottlenose dolphins are likely to be more friendly and optimistic than those around them. They often know a little about 
                    their wide varitety of interests but lack the much deeper knowledge of any particular subject that others their age might 
                    possess. They usually find that they have a large crowd of supporting friends and exccel in customer facing roles.
                    They are usually resistant to change and take on the problems of others without complaint, often to their own detrament.

                    Orcas like to stand out from the crowd. They have big personalities and are willing to do anything they can to prove it.
                    Orcas can be extremely prideful and often treat everything as a game that can be won or lost. They regularly find themselves 
                    easily bored but learn to harness this to have a million ideas a second bringing out their creativity and passion. This makes
                    them great at jobs where ingenuity is an essential element.

                    Spinner Dolphins are free spirits, not liking to be held to any place or person. They tend to be more esoteric than others and feel
                    the need to constantly be working on something. They often find the quickest solutions to any problems which others often overlook
                    Once they have their minds set on a project, they often find it takes over. This dedication helps to make them great artists and
                    excelent writers, where their dedication and ability to see things others can't can truly thrive.

                    River Dolphins are more reserved than their peers. They accept the presence of a comfortable silence and embrace being alone.
                    While river dolphins tend to have a small number of incredibly close friends. Sometimes river dolphins feel like outcasts but
                    their unique perspective often makes them some of the most successful people having wealth and oppertunities their peers can 
                    only dream of.

                    Bionic Death Dolphins tend to be blunt and often accidentally offend or hurt others without realising. This contributes to the
                    stereotype that they are mean or violent. However, despite first impressions, bionic death dolphins usually have kind hearts. 
                    Their unique perspective allows them to see solutions to problems that others are too emotionally clouded to see for themselves,
                    making them pragmatic leaders and successful business owners.
