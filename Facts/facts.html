            Bottlenose dolphins are the archetypal dolphin, having gained fame from movies and their presense in aquatic parks. However, 
            contrary to popular belief, they are not the most common dolphin worldwide. That title is owed to the common dolphin. Despite
            this they are one of the most widely studied species of dolphin and have been shown to be capable of communication through
            language, using tools, self regognition and the ability to pass knowledge on to the next generation which are products of 
            their complex intelligence. Bottlenose Dolphins have a long history with humans, from driving fish into fishermen's nets to
            locating sea mines.

            Orcas are the largest species of dolphin in the world. They inhabit a wide variety of regions, stretching from pole to pole.
            Their diets are also incredibly diverse, consisting of seals, sharks, whales and even other species of dolphins. Their nickname,
            the killer whale comes from ancient sailors who observed them hunting and killing whales. Orcas have been known to kill humans in
            captivity, where they are often kept in conditions damaging to their health, but never in the wild.

            Spinner Dolphins are a small dolphin that inhabits mostly costal waters around the tropics. They are known for their acrobatic
            spins which they do as they swim across the waves. A dolphin can make up to seven spins in a single jump. Their scientific name, 
            stenella longirostris means narrow long beaked dolphin, one of their key characteristics. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

            River dolphins inhabit rivers all around the world. In the Amazon, there are five different species of river dolphins. Often
            recognised by their pink colourings, river dolphins can also be grey. Amazon river dolphins are the largest of the river dolphins
            and have long noses which they use to search for and hunt food amongst the river's vegitation. They have been known to take advantage
            of boat wakes to catch stunned prey. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA

            Bionic death dolphins are cybernetically enhanced bottlenose dolphins. They are equipped with a multitude of weapons including 
            laser eyes and sword fins. These modifications and their extreme intelligence have allowed them to become the ultimate predators.
            However, their populaton remains very small, mostly due to the billion dollar expense of creating new cybernetic implants. Though 
            originally designed to destroy submarines in the cold war, they are now rogue elements, patrolling the seas freely.
